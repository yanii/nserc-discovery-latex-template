A XeLaTeX template for NSERC-style documents
==========================================

Fill in the info in `application-config.tex` and write your text in `example.tex` (which you can rename to whatever you like). Add references to references.bib, with the special case of references from your CCV profile, which should be added as demonstrated in the template with the keyword "ccv", and the using "citealias" to cite these. The rest should be self-explanatory.

Note that you have to use XeLaTeX to use the exact font required by NSERC (i.e. the real Times New Roman font). If you/your reviewers are less fussy, you may get away with using the standard LaTeX times fonts.

Note that I made up this class for my own personal use; I don't mind sharing it, but please don't contact me for support. I'm also not responsible if you are not awarded a grant due to any issues with this template. NSERC Discovery Grant requirements can change every year, and you should check the posted requirements the year you apply. Saying this, this template is what I used for my successful Discovery Grant application in 2021.
