%% References
%% NSERC applications require the references to be in a distinct PDF,
%% uploaded separately from the main text. The hack I suggest is to
%% write the document *with* the references at the end (like a normal
%% article, and then to split it in two manually (for example, using pdftk).
%% For Linux systems, the script split-application.sh bundled with this
%% package does exactly that.
