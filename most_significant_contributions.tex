\paragraph{\#1: \citetalias{me2016} My Most Significant Contribution. Role: First Author.}
Citing papers from your CCV should be done with a citealias, to use the CCV name of the paper (e.g. C1 is first conference paper). Note that these bibtex entries \textbf{must} have the keyword ``ccv'' so that they are excluded from the proposal references.


\paragraph{\#1: \citep{me2016notinccv} My Second Most Significant Contribution. Role: First Author.}
Citing papers not from your CCV should be done as normal.
